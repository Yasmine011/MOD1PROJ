        <h3>Meet Greylee</h3>
        <p>
            Greylee is my 1 year old Pitbull. She is also my Emotional Support Animal. She is my bestfriend , headache and my therapy all in one. When I first got her she was 6 weeks old and very active. When she got around 2 months I decided to have her registered as an Emotional Support Animal while I was going through a very rough patch in my life and having her around me and everywhere I went certainly gave me comfort. During that time in my life I felt very alone and depressed and having her around motivated me to get out of my head and bed to actually make myself happier whether it was playing with her or us simply going out for a walk. After around 5-6 months of having her i noticed a HUGE shift in my behavior and thought process. I was happier , going out more and not wallowing in my thoughts any longer. Thats what my emotional support animal did for me.
